# Summary of this project

This project was initially inspired by the YouTube channel “Chai and Code”. After following their guidance, I made several modifications on my own. A significant amount of time was invested in developing the backend of this application. The backend of a video streaming app was created using technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, bcrypt, and more. The end result is a comprehensive video hosting website akin to YouTube, complete with features such as login, signup, video upload, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, among others.
